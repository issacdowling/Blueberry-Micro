## Core
A `Core` is a modular component of your voice assistant, typically a voice-based app, or some other tool relating to it.

## Conversation
A `Conversation` is an upcoming feature that allows multi-step _conversations_ with Cores, rather than simple, single query/responses.

## Util
A `Util` is a back-end program that plays a part in the processing of your request (e.g. Text-To-Speech)

## Orchestrator
The `Orchestrator` brings together individual Utils in order to actually complete your request end-to-end.
